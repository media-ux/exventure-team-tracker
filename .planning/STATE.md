# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-27)

**Core value:** The spiderweb visualization is the live window into the whole system — zoom from company → project → sub-unit → task → file, with team members mapped at every level, fed by real-time data from Slack and OpenClaw agents.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation & Data Layer

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Schema-first approach: Prevents drift between Spiderweb UI, Slack bot, and OpenClaw agents
- Supabase for backend: Real-time subscriptions, auto-generated API, free tier
- D3.js for spiderweb: Industry standard for force-directed graphs, SVG-based
- Step-by-step Slack guide: User needs guidance, not assumptions about knowledge
- Singleton pattern for Supabase client (01-01): Ensures single instance across app, reduces memory overhead
- Keep @supabase/auth-helpers-react despite deprecation (01-01): Currently in STACK.md, migration to @supabase/ssr deferred to future phase
